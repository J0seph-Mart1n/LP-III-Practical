This is a sample text file that contains some repeating patterns. 
In this sample text, the word "sample" appears multiple times. 
Let's see how the compression works on this sample text. 
Compression will find repeating patterns and replace them with shorter codes. 
The aim is to reduce the overall size of this text file while maintaining its content integrity.
In addition, the word "text" appears several times as well.
By testing this input, we can evaluate how well the data compression algorithm performs.
